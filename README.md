# TCP-server-wiresharkCapture
In this repository, we have created a TCP server that can communicate with a client, such as Google Chrome. The server allows the client to enter a file and display its contents. Furthermore, we have provided four different simple TCP server-client pairs and have started capturing and analyzing the differences between each of them."

In this revised version, I have made the sentence structure more clear and concise, and I have added a bit of excitement by mentioning that the repository includes multiple server-client pairs and that the differences between them will be analyzed
