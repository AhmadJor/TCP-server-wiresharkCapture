# TCP Server and Wireshark Capture
## Introduction
In this repository, we present a comprehensive implementation of a TCP server in Python that can communicate with a client, such as Google Chrome. The server provides the functionality to allow the client to enter a file and display its contents.

## Analysis of TCP Server-Client Communication
In addition to the basic functionality, we have also provided four different simple TCP server-client pairs and have started capturing and analyzing the differences between each of them. The aim is to highlight the various intricacies involved in a TCP server-client communication and understand the underlying mechanics of the transfer of data between the server and client.

## Key Learnings
By working on this project, you will gain a better understanding of:
- TCP server implementation in Python
- TCP client implementation in Python
- Communication between a TCP server and client
- Wireshark capture and analysis of TCP communication

## Usage
To run the program, you need to have Python3 installed on your system. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command to start the server:
``` python3 server.py ```
In another terminal window, run the client by executing 
```python3 client.py```.

## Conclusion
This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of a TCP server in Python and highlights the differences between different server-client pairs. The project serves as a starting point for understanding the mechanics of a TCP server-client communication and provides a solid foundation for further exploration and experimentation.
